              Each time the serve is passed to a new team, that team must rotate around the court clockwise. The positions are named by numbers and are used to explain the following competitive rotations. <br>

    <ul>
      <li>
          The 4-2 rotation uses 2 setters and 4 hitters. The setters play opposite each other and whichever one is in front court will act as a setter, while the one in back court acts as an opposite.
      </li>
      <li>
          The 5-1 rotation uses a single setter who will set from front and back court. While the setter is front court, the team will have 2 front attackers and 3 defenders. While in back court, the team will have 3 attackers and 2 defenders alongside the setter.
      </li>
      <li>
          The 6-2 rotations works similar to the 4-2 rotation. However, whichever setter is backcourt will be in charge of setting for the team, meaning that the team will always have 3 attackers.
      </li>

    </ul>
