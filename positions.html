          <td>Ideally, the setter will be the second player to touch the ball after one of their team mates receive the ball. It is their job to place the ball in preperation for one of the attackers to get the final hit. </td>
          <td>Middles are usually tasked with blocking every attack and perform quick hits from the middle of the court. They may be substituted by a Libero when playing back court.</td>
          <td>The Outside hitter is the main attacker of the team, he will block middle and opposite attacks and hit from the left side of the net. When in back row, they will be tasked with recieving deep balls and performing back court hits.</td>
          <td>The Opposite hitter functions similarly to the outside hitter when in front court, however on the right side of the court. When in back row, they will be defending shorter attacks.</td>
          <td>The Libero only plays backcourt and cannot serve. They are tasked with recieving majority of the balls and focus on short attacks on the left side of the court.</td>
